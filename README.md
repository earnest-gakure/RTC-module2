# RTC-module2 project
## Project Overview
This project involves integrating a TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller unit (MCU) with an RTC (Real-Time Clock) module using SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication. The RTC module is designed to provide accurate time and date information.

## Components:
###TM4C123GH6PM MCU:

A powerful microcontroller unit with versatile features.
Acts as the main controller for the project.
RTC Module:

### Real-Time Clock module for accurate timekeeping.
Utilizes SPI communication for interfacing with the MCU.
Provides time and date information.
Sensor:

Connects to the RTC module for gathering relevant data.
Uses SPI communication to exchange information with the MCU.
### 16x2 LCD Display:

A display module to visualize the time and date.
Will be used to showcase the real-time data retrieved from the RTC module.
## Project Flow:
MCU and RTC Integration:

The TM4C123GH6PM MCU communicates with the RTC module using SPI.
The MCU retrieves time and date information from the RTC module.
Sensor Integration:

The sensor is connected to the RTC module, ensuring synchronized data acquisition.
LCD Display:

The MCU processes the time and date information.
The 16x2 LCD display module is utilized to showcase the real-time data.
